## Description

The main objective was to replicate the mockup as closely as possible. Additionally, subpages for other offers and contact were created. The contact subpage features a contact form structure and a mini Google Map. The main page includes a scroll-spy script, which can be observed in the top menu.

The JavaScript code, CSS, and all the images used on the website have been minified.
